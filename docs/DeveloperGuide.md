## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete id/E0123456`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ScheduleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete id/E0123456")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete E0123456` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Group` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Group` object per unique group, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Group` objects. Additionally, a `Remark` can also be encapsulated in the `Schedule` class to ensure more OOP-ness while allowing each `Person` to have multiple `Schedules` with its corresponding `Remark`<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### `Add` feature

`Add` for a person can be added using the `add` command. The `AddCommand` class is responsible for handling the addition of a person. This command is implemented through `AddCommand` which extends the `Command` class.

A new `Person` can be added by specifying `NUSID`, `name`, `phone`, `email`, `tags` and optional `group`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There can be 0 or more optional `group`.

</box>

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add` command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `AddCommandParser`.

Step 3. `AddCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `AddCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `AddCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `AddCommand` executes and calls `Model#addPerson()` to add the person to the address book.

Step 6. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addPerson()` and the person will not be added to the address book.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an add operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs a schedule command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**How add executes**

* User inputs an `add` command with `NUSID`, `name`, `phone`, `email`, `tags` and optional `group` fields. The inputs are parsed and a `AddCommand` is created.
* The instances of the relevant fields are created and the person is added to the model.

**Alternative considerations**  

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create instances of objects for each of the fields and add the person to the model.
    * Pros: Allow for each field to be validated before adding the person.
    * Cons: Additional checks are required.

### `Edit` feature

#### Implementation

`Edit` on a person can be done using the `edit` command. The `EditCommand` class is responsible for handling the editing of a person's information. This command is implemented through `EditCommand` which extend the `Command` class.

A new `Edit` can be added by specifying a compulsory `NUSID`, while `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `TAG` and `GROUP` are optional fields but the user needs to enter at least 1 of these optional fields.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Existing values will be replaced by and updated to the new input values.

</box>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `EditCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `Edit` command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `EditCommandParser`.

Step 3. `EditCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `EditCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `EditCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `EditCommand` executes and calls `Model#getFilteredPersonListWithNusId()` to get a list of person in the address book and filter to find the relevant person with the given `NUSID`.

Step 6. `Model#setPerson()` is called to update the contact information for that person.

Step 7. `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called to update the person list.

Step 8. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setPerson()` and the contact information will not be updated for that person.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a schedule operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs an Edit command:

<puml src="diagrams/EditDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**How edit executes**

* User inputs a `Edit` command with `NUSID`, and at least 1 of these optional fields: `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `TAG` and `GROUP`. The inputs are parsed and a `EditCommand` is created.
* A list of persons is retrieved from `model` and the relevant person is found by matching `NUSID`.
* The relevant fields are updated for the person and the person is set back into the model.


**Alternative considerations**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create instances of objects for each of the fields and edits the person's contact information to the model.
    * Pros: Allow for each field to be validated before editing the person.
    * Cons: Additional checks are required.
    

### `Schedule` feature

#### Implementation

`Schedule` for a person can be added or removed using the `schedule` command. The `ScheduleCommand` class is responsible for handling the scheduling of events for a person. This command is implemented through `ScheduleCommand` which extends the `Command` class.

A new `Schedule` can be added by specifying `NUSID`, `schedule` and `remark`. If the `schedule` and `remark` prefixes are not specified, the schedule will be removed instead.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `schedule` and `remark` are either both present or absent.

</box>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ScheduleCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `Schedule` command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `ScheduleCommandParser`.

Step 3. `ScheduleCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `ScheduleCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `ScheduleCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `ScheduleCommand` executes and calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get a list of person in the address book and filter to find the relevant person with the given `NUSID`. 

Step 6. `Model#setPerson()` is called to update the schedule for that person.

Step 7. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setPerson()` and the schedule will not be updated for that person.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a schedule operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ScheduleSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs a schedule command:

<puml src="diagrams/ScheduleDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**How schedule executes**

* User inputs a `Schedule` command with `NUSID`, `schedule` and  `remark`. The inputs are parsed and a `ScheduleCommand` is created.
* A list of persons is retrieved from `model` and the relevant person is found by matching `NUSID`.
* The relevant fields are updated for the person and the person is set back into the model.

**Why is it implemented this way?**

* The functionality of adding and removing schedule is similar to the `EditCommand`. Both require changes in the `Person` object.
* Hence, the approach is similar to how `edit` command works.

**Alternative considerations**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set the schedule for the person by indicating `schedule` and `remark`, otherwise remove schedule.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Additional checks are required to check if it is an add or remove schedule command.

* **Alternative 2:** Introduce add schedule and remove schedule command as separate commands.
    * Pros: There is usage of Single Responsibility Principle.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* **Alternative 3:** Since schedule and edit commands are similar, we could consider adding a generic class which both extend from.
    * Pros: It follows the DRY principle.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### `Find` feature

A `Person` has many details one may query for, this command searches for contacts that matches all the given details.
Currently, this command supports finding by `NUSID`, `name`, `phone`, `email`, `group`s, `tag` fields.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `find` requires at least one field mentioned above to be an input

</box>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find` command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `FindCommandParser`.

Step 3. `FindCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `FindCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `FindCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `FindCommand` executes and finds the relevant person(s) with the given fields.

Step 6. `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called to update the list of persons displayed in AronaPro.

Step 7. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and the list of persons displayed remains the same.
**Note:** If a command finds no person, it will display an empty list and not an error message.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a find operation goes through the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram">

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs a `find` command:
<puml src="diagrams/FindActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindActivityDiagram">

#### Design considerations:

**How find executes**

* User inputs a `find` command with at least one of the fields `NUSID`, `name`, `phone`, `email`, `group` or `tag`. The inputs are parsed and a `FindCommand` is created.
* Each of these fields are made into Java `Predicates` which checks if each field's input matches any person's field (Choice of matching can be changed flexibly in each field's corresponding `Predicate` class) in AronaPro.
* If any field was not required by the user, a special string (not possible for the user to type when using the add or edit commands) is used to default the `Predicate` to True.
* A list of persons is created by chaining these `Predicates` using logical `AND`. A list of relevant person(s) are found.
* The relevant persons are used to update the person list which the model displays.

**Why is it implemented this way?**

* The functionality of find is advertised as finding people that matches ALL the supplemented fields. As such logical AND search is relevant to our case.
* Use of predicates is also easily extendable, requiring future programmers to simply create a new `Predicate` for new fields and chaining it with the existing predicates
* The use of a special string to denote a non-specified field, while rudimentary, avoids the hassle required to juggle Java `Optional`s and less transparent Functional Programming paradigms.

**Alternative considerations**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set non-required fields to a special string that makes a field match everyone, otherwise filter based on the input.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: If the user is able to enter this special string in `add` or `edit` commands, it could result in unexpected behaviour.

* **Alternative 2:** Introduce Java `Optional`s to determine which fields are required.
    * Pros: There is usage of Single Responsibility Principle. (Current implementation has `Predicate` implicitly handling added responsibility of checking optionality)
    * Cons: Harder to debug when using Functional Programming paradigms while passing results across classes.

### `Pin` feature

`Pin` for a person can be done using the `pin` command. The `PinCommand` class is responsible for handling the addition of a person. This command is implemented through `PinCommand` which extend the `Command` class.

A `Person` can be pinned by specifying `NUSID`.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `PinCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `pin` command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `PinCommandParser`.

Step 3. `PinCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `PinCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `PinCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `PinCommand` executes and calls `Model#pinPerson()` to add the person to the address book.

Step 6. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#pinPerson()` and the person will not be added to the address book.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a pin operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/PinSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="PinSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs a pin command:

<puml src="diagrams/PinDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**How Pin executes**

* User inputs a `pin` command with `NUSID`.The inputs are parsed and a `PinCommand` is created.
* The instances of the relevant fields are created and the person is added to the model.


### `Group` feature

`Group` for a person can be added using the `group` command. The `GroupCommand` class is responsible for handling the grouping and the tagging of a person. This command is implemented through `GroupCommand` which extends the `Command` class.

A new `Person` can be grouped by specifying `NUSID` and either `group` and/or `tag`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There needs to be at least one `group` and/or `tag` keyword.
**Note:** More than one `NUSID` keyword can be used if grouping more than one person at once.

</box>

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `GroupCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `group` command with `NUSID`, `group` and  `tag`.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` will call `parseCommand` on the user's input string and return an instance of `GroupCommandParser`.

Step 3. `GroupCommandParser` will call `parse` which create instances of objects for each of the fields and return an instance of `GroupCommand`.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `GroupCommand`.

Step 5. The `execute` method in `GroupCommand` executes and creates a list of Persons `personToGroup`. It then calls `Model#setPerson()` on all Persons in the list to modify the group and tag fields of the Persons in the address book.

Step 6. Success message is printed onto the results display to notify user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setPerson()` and the Persons will not be grouped in the address book.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how a group operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="GroupSequenceDiagram" />


#### Design considerations:

**How group executes**

* User inputs an `group` command with `NUSID` and either `tags` and/or `group` fields. The inputs are parsed and a `GroupCommand` is created.
* The instances of the relevant fields are created and the person(s) is/are grouped in the model.
